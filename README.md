Developer Bio - React Native App
This is a complete developer portfolio/bio application, built with React Native and Expo. The project was developed iteratively through 16 exercises covering everything from initial architecture to API consumption, global state management, local storage, and styling with a dynamic theme (light/dark).

‚ú® Features
Complete Navigation: Utilizes Stack and Bottom Tab Navigators for a fluid user experience.

Dynamic Profile: Home and Profile sections that display developer information.

Real API Consumption:

List of projects fetched directly from the GitHub API.

List of articles fetched from the Dev.to API.

Global State Management: React's Context API is used to manage user data and the application theme.

Data Persistence: Uses AsyncStorage to save the application history, preserving data even after the app is closed.

Dynamic Theme: A settings screen allows the user to switch between light and dark mode throughout the entire application.

WebView: Articles open within the app for an integrated reading experience.

Organized Code: Modular folder structure (screens, contexts, navigation, styles) to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
