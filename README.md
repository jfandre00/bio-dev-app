# üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Bio - React Native App

This is a complete developer portfolio/bio application, built with **React Native** and **Expo**.  
The project was developed iteratively through 16 exercises covering everything from initial architecture to API consumption, global state management, local storage, and styling with a dynamic theme (light/dark).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Complete Navigation:** Uses Stack and Bottom Tab Navigators for a smooth experience.  
- **Dynamic Profile:** Home and Profile screens display developer information.  
- **Real API Consumption:**  
  - Project list fetched directly from the **GitHub API**.  
  - Article list fetched from the **Dev.to API**.  
- **Global State Management:** React‚Äôs Context API is used to manage user data and the app theme.  
- **Data Persistence:** **AsyncStorage** is used to save the app history, preserving data even after the app is closed.  
- **Dynamic Theme:** A settings screen allows switching between **light** and **dark mode** across the entire app.  
- **WebView:** Articles open within the app for an integrated reading experience.  
- **Organized Code:** Modular folder structure (`screens`, `contexts`, `navigation`, `styles`) to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
